                <p>Those who pass the tests of the Crucible may be suited for further training. here are three categories of skill we offer off world clients: hunter, warrior, and shadow killer.</p>
                <p>But no matter what your role, you should always wear the clothing and accoutrements that brand you as Dathomiri, for through your visibility our reputation will spread.</p>
                <p>Hunters should wear the red hoods and robes like the blood trail they follow, as well as black wrist wraps to protect from the sting of their weapon. A hunter wields an energy bow with a plasma bowstring and arrows of the same material. The energy bow can fire plasma arrows unerringly at any target, and its bowstring can blind or burn should you need to use it as a bludgeon. It is a specialty weapon. I therefore, it is vital that our clan be supplied with the standard nine credits from every ten you earn, so we may continue to outfit you with the equipment you require.</p>
                <p>Shadow killers are assassins. They wear black wraps of the night and carry silent weapons, such as the dagger and the poison dart. It is an art to become one with the dark.</p>
                <p>Shadow killers can also be aided by spirit ichor. Shamans, such as l, can conjure a mist that allows our shadow killers to operate midway between the physical realm and the spirit realm.</p>
                <p>Our warriors wear the cuffs and shoulder armor of those who have withstood the Crucible. Their weapons, such as pikes, are infused with powerful magick and can cut. through any substance.</p>
                <p>Through the magicks of the Fanged God, a warrior can be transformed into an avatar of primal anger. his requires the skill of an expert shaman and a full couen of crafters.</p>
                <p>By conjuring green spirit ichor and channeling the rawest hatred, the energies can be siphoned into hulking muscle and bone. A transformed warrior will be massive, standing a head taller, boasting a broad chest and spine-crushing arms. A proud Zabrak of the Nightbrothers will grow a crown of horns to rival that of a verne buck in autumn.</p>
                <p>Although the Crucible tests a candidate s skill, it is not the end of their training.</p>
                <p>It is a second beginning. Candidates who reach this point are skilled in combat, but they lack the subtle touch needed to channel the abilities of the spirits. Emotion is a powerful catalyst that connects you to your bestial essence and, by extension, to the ur-spirits that rule our natural impulses. To strengthen these abilities, order candidates to accomplish a task that requires utter concentration —then distract them with mocking taunts and the agony of a barbed lash. There is no shorter path to the revelation that it is not peace but passion that leads to achievement.</p>
                <p>Train your students well. It has been foretold by Allya that a perfect being will one day arise-one brought into existence by the spirits and one who will embody the balance between the Winged Goddess and the Fanged God. Perhaps it will be you who will train this champion. Perhaps it is you.</p>
