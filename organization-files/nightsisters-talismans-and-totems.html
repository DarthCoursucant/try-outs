                <p>As clan shaman, it is within my power to entreat the spirits. Because the Night-sisters are their favored children, they may agree to empower a receptacle in the physical realm where their essence will sleep until summoned. These receptacles, crafted by shamans into talismans and totems, may hold their power for generations.</p>
                <p>Talismans are often gems set in rings or pendants. Totems are carved objects depicting an animal or a spirit entity.</p>
                <p>When kept within a dwelling, these objects offer a blessing to all who pass through the doorway. Those who swallow a totem will release all its energy into themselves—-though their omnipotence will last only moments. For when the spirit is released from the object, it returns to the spirit realm and reduces the body to ash.</p>
                <p>Talismans of Transformation allow the wearer to change shape in the physical realm. to become an animal and fap into the animal spirt essence, for example The Nightsisters possess several Talismans of Transformation— the bolma, the brackaset, the eollu, and the burra fish. One of our sisters has yet to return the Talisman of the Rauen. The Talisman of Age taps into the animal nature of humans, and briefly restores the vigor of youth.</p>
                <p>Talismans of finding are shaped to resemble a compass and will guide the user to any target that has been imprinted upon it. Talismans of Resurrection can bring the spirits of the dead back to their physical bodies. It is vital to remember, however that it much time has passed, their forms may be little more than fetid skeletons. Finally,</p>
                <p>Talismans of Counter-spell offer protection from the magicks of others by deflecting curses back onto their casters.</p>
                <p>Totems of the Elementals can summon night, Sunlight, Smoke, Ice, Flame, Clay, and Woodrot These are powerful, primal entities, so they may not always obey your bidding. Totems of familiars are more welcoming. They will call an animal to your side and hold the animal there as long as you possess the totem. The summoned beast is blessed with magick. The energies of these familiars help crafters accomplish some of the most difficult magicks.</p>
