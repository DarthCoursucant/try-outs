                <h1>The History Of Nightsisters</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>

                <p>It is a blessing to be born on Dathomir.. and a burden. We are the favored people of the spirits and much is expected of us. We must not mar our home with the pollution of technology.</p>
                <p>We must obey our clan mothers and shamans. We must revere the rituals that bind the physical and spiritual realms. With such simple edicts, it is disappointing that so many witches have failed to obey them.</p>
                <p>The writings of Allya teach that those who choose ignorance will never know greatness, and those who fear death will never achieve power. But after Allya's death, some of her daughters—-perhaps weakened by the Jedi blood in their veins-added to Allya's words by introducing " 'good" and " evil." They claimed Allya had espoused this blasphemy during the last moments of her life. These witches called this altered text the Book of Law.</p>
                <p>Those who rejected this altered text and held true to Allya's pure words became the first nightsisters. Our nightsister ancestors were banished from the home clans for their beliefs. But among their fellow believers, they restored the text to Allya s original teachings—to the balance of the physical realm and the spirit realm. They named their volume the Book of Shadows. In the past, competing nightsister clans have coexisted, each led by a clan mother and a shaman— except in cases where the two figures are one and the same. But I have united my warring sisters into a single couen.</p>
                <p>Every witch of Dathomir knows that males lack the ability the females possess to balance the twin calls of the Winged Goddess and Fanged God. Males are simpler, more beast-like. We honor our nightbrothers, but among our clan we recognize that they serve the spirits better when kept in isolation. In the past, other clans integrated their males as servants or slaves, but our nightbrothers are kept separated until summoned. In their compound, they naturally form a pack-like structure and channel their virile energy into combat training.</p>
