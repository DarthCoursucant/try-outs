                <h1>Competing Dark Side Tradtitions</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container-one">
                <p>We reject the term "dark side," but it is commonly applied because of the cultural pull of the Jedi and the Sith. Those who use the powers of the supernatural —or, as others call it, the Force— in order to kill at their employer's behest are considered dark siders. It is clear that if we are to be thus classified, we should market ourselves as such.</p>
                <p>You will find yourself among many who do not understand our traditions. They may call you Sith, or any number of other prominent traditions. Use this chance to set the Nightsisters apart in the minds of those who hold power. Only by promoting our unique skills will we be able to continue to command a premium price.</p>
                <p>The Prophets of the Dark Side are similar to the Sith in many ways. Their breakaway religion splintered from the teachings of a Sith Lord, Darth Millennial, but the Prophets are not warriors. They claim to possess unparalleled skill in fortune-telling, and some have approached our clients promising to reveal the outcomes of galactic events yet to come. doubt the spirits whisper to them with any clarity, and only a witch in the grip of insanity would be charmed by their religion. I suspect their pronouncements are empty shells made from self-fulfilling statements. Plant this seed of doubt if the opportunity arises.</p>
                <p>New claimants to the dark side tradition have arisen from the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The Kanzer Exiles are a group of reptilians from the Ualtaullu Rift who claim allegiance to their Lord Rauager. And the Knell of Muspilli is a death cult that dwells amid the moon-trees of the Gunninga Gap. Whether these groups are true representatives or merely opportunists is unclear. However, their claims to power are quite specific. The Kanzer Exiles assert that they have the power to enslave many minds at once. The Knell alleges to have the abilities to summon apocalyptic deities from the realm beyond shadows. If either group should fail to fulfill these declarations, we will have our evidence to expose its members as frauds.</p>
                <p>The most enigmatic of the new competitors are the Sorcerers of Rhand. They claim a kinship with the dark, which they view as the embodiment of decay and death. A true Sorcerer is said to be able to use a psychic blast to eradicate an object or a living being. They are not believed to operate outside the nihil Retreat, but make an effort to learn more of their ways if you can.</p>
                <p>Other groups have been in this game of dark side mercenaries for centuries, far longer than the nightsisters. These are our prime competitors. Do what you must to dissolve their hold among the powerful of the Core and Rim.</p>
                <p>The influence of the Tapani sector's royal houses is strong. Among House Mecett's nobles there are those who claim affinity with the Sith, and whose ancestors triggered the Cleansing of the Nine Mouses, which not only destabilized an entire quadrant of the galaxy but swallowed three other noble houses. The agents of House Mecetti belong to the Mecrosa Order. They specialize in assassination. I know our skills are superior, for | sent three shadow killers to the Pella system to test their skills. Two of ours returned, but none of the lecrosa opponents survived.</p>
                <p>The Blackquard operates from the molten world of Mustafar. They are largely recluses and have sought dark side lore since they emerged from the ruins of Sith philosophy after the Battle of Ruusan nearly a thousand years ago. The Blackguard clings to the principle that acquiring knowledge is superior to exerting physical power.</p>
                <p>It makes them a careful and cautious rival. For now, they are too isolated to factor into our plans.</p>
                <p>The Shapers of Kro Var are few in number, but they profess to be shamans of a similar tradition to our own. do not doubt they have gained a small glimpse into the spirit realm, but they are not native to Dathomir. They cannot have heard the call of the spirits as clearly as we have. The Shapers of Kro Var use dark magick to manipulate the elements of air, earth, water, and fire. They have recently made their services available to buyers in the Marzoon sector.</p>
                <p>Only the clan mothers may broker the services of the nightsisters. But not all Nightsisters have equal expertise We will not repeat he mistakes of Sharman Yensu Grjak, who too eagerly sold the services of her clan to Separatist buyers and then could not protect her sisters from the Jedi counterattack.</p>
                <p>By offering your seruices, you agree to perform any mission on your client s behalf, provided it falls under the terms brokered by the clan mother. The nightsisters will not tolerate dishonor, no matter who provides the funding. Those who treat us as it we were primitives to be swindled will be punished —a warning to others and further evidence of our lethal aptitude.</p>
