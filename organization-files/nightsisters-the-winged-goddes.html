                <h1>The Winged Goddes</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container-one">
                <p>In the spirit realm, the Winged Goddess appears as a blinding-white gryphon. It is she who governs fertility and growth, and she who acts as a mediator to reconcile wounded parties. She knows everything that has occurred and everything that is yet to come.</p>
                <p>Channeling the Winged Goddess brings forth great quantities of spirit ichor into the physical realm.</p>
                <p>This ichor appears as green smoke, but it can be given physical shape and mass as well as be manipulated in spell casting by a gifted shaman such as myself.</p>
                <p>A skilled shaman may conjure objects from raw spirit ichor.</p>
                <p>The conjured object is everlasting and can take many forms such as a hunting lance or a goblet of boiled black root. Divination and scrying are achieved by shaping the spirit ichor into a sphere and peering into its depths. Through scrying, a shaman can view events occurring anywhere in the galaxy Divination or heart shadow, calls forth visions of possible futures. Through this art, I have learned the fall of empires yet to come and how to protect the nightsisters from those who would seek to exploit us.</p>
                <p>In spell casting, spirit ichor can become the waters of life and be used to heal wounds or restore memories. When used in conjunction with crafters chanting incantations, I can channel the ichor to rejuvenate the near-dead by coaxing the injured spirit to emerge from hibernation.</p>
                <p>Mesmerism is another gift provided by spirit ichor. This power allows a shaman to override the thoughts of those weaker than oneself—-particularly men and off worlders. A tap of the fingertip to the victim's forehead will induce a trancelike state and make the victim powerless to refuse your commands.</p>
                <p>Another form of control is achieved by crafting a small statue of a victim, combining a strand of hair and a roiling cauldron brimming with the waters of life. This crude figure may then be stabbed with wooden needles or weakened with a breath of miasma. Any harm done to the totem will be felt by the victim it resembles But nothing comes without a cost. The effort required of the shaman to summon such quantities of ichor can prove exhausting.</p>
                <p>I do not wish to disturb the Winged Goddess with endless supplications, but in times of severe distress, I have used the shaman's connection to directly invoke the spirits. When the call succeeds, the specters of long-ago warriors will glow into view.</p>
                <p>Heralded by a rush of wind, they will charge a target while uttering a shriek that emanates from every direction at once.</p>
