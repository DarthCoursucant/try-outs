                <h1>The Beasts Of Dathomir</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container-one">
                <p>The living creatures of our home are too numerous to name. They create a life web that is stronger than those found on any other planet in the galaxy. This is because Dathomir is a conduit to the spirit realm, and the keystone upon which all reality is balanced.</p>
                <p>Skilled Nightsisters can channel the abilities of Dathomiri beasts they have never met simply by recognizing their spirit scents. While you're in other parts of the galaxy, it is essential to your success that you frequently reacquaint yourself with our brother and sister animals. When you know their natures, you can better channel their qualities. The practice will also reestablish your connection with the life web if you have spent too many days among the machines of the off worlders— especially the accursed mausoleum of glass and steel called Coruscant.</p>
                <p><b>The great rancor</b> is the ruler of all beasts on Dathomir. Spawned from the ferocity of <b>the Fanged God</b> and the insight of <b>the Winged Goddes</b>, it is a fierce fighter that rakes with its claws and tears with its powerful teeth. Yet <b>rancors</b> are wise and tender toward their own. Their arms help them swing through the canopy to hunt screeching <b>purboles</b>, and their massive legs propel their lumbering runs when they pursue fleeing bolma herds. The Nightsisters connect with them, speak to them, and ride them. Be like the rancor, and you will hold authority in any confrontation you face among outsiders.</p>
                <p><b>The drebbin</b> and <b>the ssurrians</b> are also major predators on Dathomin. Their thick hides allow them to ignore most irritants, and other creatures have learned to back away when they see one of these creatures for fear they will disappear in a snap of teeth. Like <b>the drebbin</b> and <b>the ssurrians</b>, we do not need to change or accommodate those smaller and weaker than us.</p>
                <p>Other beasts of the wild that do not have the biggest muscles or the sharpest claws possess more devious methods to achieve their ends. <b>The artery worm</b> strikes from inside, traveling the blood upstream and killing its host in exquisite agony when it reaches the heart.</p>
                <p><b>The voritor lizard</b> and <b>the Kodashi viper</b> trade size for poison, and announce their malevolence with bright colors and vivid patterns. Remember this when donning the clothing, markings, and weapons of a nightsister. An intimidating appearance will frighten away those who are not fully committed to a fight.</p>
                <p>Every time we eat the meat of a <b>whuffa worm</b> or wear its skin, we are reminded that life is connected. Look at the <b>gibbit bird</b>, which picks the scraps from the rancor's teeth. The rancor is cleaned, the bird is fed, and both parties benefit.</p>
                <p>Like the wild animals, regardless of size, you are never defenseless. Small threats can be deadly threats. Consider the <b>sparkfly</b>, which has a sting that contains all the energy of the sky's lightning.</p>
                <p>Or the <b>scissorfist</b>, which has claws that when latched on to an atfacker's skin can never be pried apart. Even the mighty rancor may be felled by shear mites, which can chew through its hide with their acid-laced mandibles. Do not fear your enemies. Life always persists even a sauage, blood-drenched death only returns your spirit to the realm beyond shadow</p>
