                <p>The Battle of Ashas Ree is over-another victory for the Empire!</p>
                <p>And once again, the unworthy have sought status in the wake of this triumph. Adraas is nothing but a vile rootworm feeding on the carcasses of the beasts I slay. One day I will no longer tolerate his antics. I will make him suffer.</p>
                <p>The Dark Council recognized the role I played in planet's defense and has informed me, through one of its agents, that I will not again experience a materiel shortage like the one that cost us Ord Radama. The Council's approval is meaningless, but I will gladly accept its resources.</p>
                <p>I received word from Imperial Intelligence that Jedi Master  Ven Zallow and his forces are headquartered on Serenno. That ancient world of noble houses would react too swiftly to a direct assault, so I have activated an infiltrator.</p>
                <p>The Emperor, in his wisdom, spent many decades installing Sith infiltrators in positions of power across the galaxy-long before our armada fired its first shot. Indeed, these agents turned the governments of Ruuria, Sernpidal, and Belkadan to our cause. Their devious work allowed for the ambush of the Republic fleet in the Tingel Arm-our first major victory in this war.</p>
                <p>Only a fraction of the Emperor's infiltrators have been activated to date. But Darth Caba has gathered intelligence reports, which indicate a high-ranking Serenno noble, who has the ear of Master Zallow, is secretly one of ours.</p>
                <p>There is urgency to this situation, however. Information provided by high-ranking agents-ciphers, they call themselves suggests the Republic may soon move from Serenno to a new forward base. If we do not strike now, we will lose our moment.</p>
                <p>The assassination of Master Zallow and the disruption of the Republic's command structure must be carried out. But I have been told I must wait for one of the infiltrators to complete the mission. And so we wait for word of success to come through the cipher network.</p>
                <p>My warships stand ready. I will not eat, drink, or sleep until we have joined battle. Denial quickens the senses and sharpens the mind. I must be in top form, for Serenno is crawling with Jedi.</p>
