                        <p>The jedi teach six forms of lightsaber combat. This in excessive and a waste of time. There is no need for a Sith Lord to study any form that does not channel one's aggression.</p>
                        <p>A battle should end quickly. At every moment, one should be assessing the ways to dispatch one's opponent-select the most direct method.</p>
                        <p>There are two key forms of lightsaber combat a Sith must master: Strong style and Fast style. The latter emphasizes footwork, speed, precision, and acrobatics. With some exceptions- such as the tactics of my own apprentice-Fast style is rarely suited for a Sith. </p>

                        <p>The dark side supplies us with strength, and that strength must be used. Hate makes us powerful.</p>
                        <p>Strong style is expressed as djem so-an ancient philosophy that requires you to combine your body weight and your muscular strength with the energizing drug of anger so that the execution of your blows will land with enough force to crack armor.</p>
                        <p>When used for defense, djem so turns an attack back on the attacker.</p>
                        <p>If you deflect a blade at a vulnerable angle, it will draw your opponent in close enough for a gutting slash or an elbow to the face.</p>

                        <p>Deflecting a blow may also draw your enemy into a blade lock, which is easily won with the strength of your arms and the power of your hate.</p>
                        <p>Another facet of Strong style defense is shien, or blocking st incoming blaster fire. When generating this defense, some G choose to use a reverse grip on the lightsaber hilt. Sith shien should be a temporary measure-used only long enough to shorten the blade distance to your opponent or to recover from a kill so that you may find your next target. Deflecting bolts against your attackers can be useful, but be aware that this tactic is a waste of your physical prowess.</p>

                        <p>Any combat situation or style can be enhanced by the use of dun möch. This tactic employs taunts and verbal artacks to weaken your enemy's will.</p>
                        <p>It takes only a few words to expose your opponent's lack of confidence and to lay it out to manipulate.</p>
                        <p>There is a third style, though it is exceedingly difficult. It is called Two-or, as my blademaster obscurely referred to it, Vaapad-and it is a style the Jedi foolishly forbid.</p>
                        <p>The key to this style is the same as our core belief:</p>
                        <p><b>Emotion, not peace, will lead to victory.</b></p>

                        <p>With Jujo, you must give yourself over to the sensations you feel in the heat of battle: hatred for your enemies; fury toward their actions; and fear that they may prevail. Yes, fear. It is foolish to cover this emotion behind pride. Fear of death, fear of loss, and fear of chaos are primal motivators. Fear can be your fuel.</p>
                        <p>Jugo is based on quick strikes and unpredictable attacks, bur you are not fully embracing the style unless your emotions ignite your senses and elevate your abilities. But do nor succumb completely to your emotions. You are a Sith Lord, not an animal. As you take aim and fight through the runnel of rage, you will experience transcendence. In that moment, you are a perfect being and you cannot be beaten- you are at last embraced within Juyo.</p>
