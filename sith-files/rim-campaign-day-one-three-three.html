            <div id="power-of-sith-text">
                <p>Despite our setback, the will of my army remains strong. We have been deployed to Ord Radama. Our bivouac is secure, and I have a moment of quiet.</p>
                <p>We arrived here four days ago. The dropships touched down under heavy fire, and I led the disembarkation alongside Darth Venemal. Our lightsabers provided a sufficient screen for he single file lines of infantry behind us. We charged the leavy guns embedded in the cliff face, and they roared o life in response.</p>
                <p>When both transports exploded at our backs, I knew the Republic's gunners had chosen the wrong targets. We had several critical seconds before they could ready another shot. By that time, we had reached the cover of the rocks at the cliff's base. Had they fired at the two Sith Lords leading the way, our assault would have ended there. Not even I can deflect a cannon burst from a Merr-Sonn Bellower.</p>
                <p>I ordered Lord Venemal to leap onto the shelf from which the cannon barrels protruded. Moments later, the machinery fell silent and he signaled the all clear. The commandos fired their ascension hooks and joined him on top.</p>
                <p>Leading the remaining troops up the mountain trail, a tremor in the Force echoed through me. The defenders of Ord Radama had placed mines on the path. Enraged by such cowardice, I hurled a boulder from the mountainside onto the path in front of us. I then slowly rolled it twenty paces ahead of our own progress, using focused mental energy channeled through the dark side. The stone detonated each of the mines and scattered a nest of ambushers. My fire troopen took care of them with the spray of their flamethrower</p>
                <p>We rejoined Venemal's team at the mountain's crest. His commandos had swept the Republic stronghold, leaving no survivors. I had to congratulate their thoroughness.</p>
                <p>Our communications officer signaled the Lindworm, and the rest of our troops landed on the field we had just secured. From start to finish, we lost only two dropships and their crews.</p>
                <p>This evening, as my soldiers readied their gear, I summoned them to bolster their spirits. Standing atop a siege tank, my mighty call echoed for kilometers:</p>
                <p>"YOU ARE SERVANTS OF THE EMPEROR AND OF THE EMPIRE! YOU ARE THE ENGINE OF CONFLICT. YOU ARE TRANSFORMING THE  GALAXY “</p>
                <p>The soldiers raised their weapons and their voices in agreement. Our progress has been swift. We will soon take the capital city of Livien  Magnus</p>
