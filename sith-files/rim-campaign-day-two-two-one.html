                <p>The Republic pursued us. The Mandalorian Blockade has now fully crumbled. The enemy fleet has penetrated Imperial space.</p>
                <p>The Republic made a strike at Korriban, though they have threatened that world far too many times for me to consider it their true target. So it was expected when their fleet jumped, but it is now gathered before Ziost</p>
                <p>Our situation is dire, and victory hinges on space superiority.</p>
                <p>The Republic's capital ships have not broken our defensive line, but their small starfighters have easily slipped through our screen. The Battle of Ziost will be won by the pilots.</p>

Our ISF interceptors are lightweight and maneuverable.

Our Fury-class interceptors act as heavy transports, patrolling the borders of the fray to pick off any ship that tries to make a break for the surface.</p>
                <p>Darth Angral believes we are evenly matched with the Republic, and that we have arrived at an impasse. He is requisitioning more naval vessels from Dromund Kaas.</p>
                <p>I have urged caution. A Jedi commander skilled in battle meditation could link warships and starfighters into a single mind, and the Jedi have other tricks that</p>
