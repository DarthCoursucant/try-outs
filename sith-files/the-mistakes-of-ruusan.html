                <h1>The Mistakes Of Ruusan</h1>
                    <p>All are equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness." Those putrid words fell from the ups of Lord Kaan more times than I care to remember. This central lie, upon which Kaan built his false Sith, is the reason behind their watery, diluted power.</p>
                    <p>The so-called New Sith Wars lasted a thousand years. Many warlords during that time sought to control the destiny of the Sith Empire. They achieved victories from the Battle of Mizra to the Sictus Wars, but those were victories without a clear line of succession. Every Sith wanted to be king. And so we argued, while the Republic grew frail-its citizens sickened with plague-and became isolated by a decaying infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Coruscant's throat lay bare beneath our blades, but the Sith plunged their knives into one another's backs instead! Kaan was not the worst of these fools, only the last.</p>
                    <p>Kaan created the Brotherhood of Darkness to end this squabbling, but he chose a false egalitarianism over a strong central rule. Within the Brotherhood, all members with rank called themselves Sith Lords. This was Kaan's first mistake.</p>
                    <p>I served in the Brotherhood of Darkness as a sergeant assigned to the Gloom Walkers and led my comrades in the capture of Phaseem. If we had maintained a sound military strategy and followed an orderly conquest, the Republic would have been ours. But Kaan was impatient. He overreached and leaped into the Bormea sector, the Republic's heart, before it was time.</p>
                    <p>This was his second mistake.</p>
                    <p>Kaan's third and final mistake came at Ruusan, a worthless world where he hoped to defeat Lord Hoth and the Jedi Army of Light. He was instead goaded into a grinding land war of needless attrition. I watched it unfold and knew the Sith had become like the Jedi-too numerous and too weak. Kaan had lost his grip.</p>
                    <p>In the end, Kaan followed my suggestion and pooled the abilities of the other Sith Lords to create a brute-force wonder: the thought bomb. This was proof of what the dark side could achieve when it wasn't split among thousands. However, the thought bomb consumed not only the Jedi combatants but also the Sith who had created it. It ended the war and exterminated Lord Kaan's Brotherhood.</p>
