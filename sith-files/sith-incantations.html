                        <p>Alchemy is my science, yet I have found the Sith Purebloods possess a new understanding of how to manipulate the dark side.</p>
                        <p>I sought the secrets of spellasting in my pilfered holocron, but its guardian was jcalous.</p>
                        <p>Casting my net wider, I recovered scrolls submerged in the blood slurry of the Mongrel Altar.</p>
                        <p>They were concealed behind a mural of King Adas at the Eternal Pyre, interred alongside the headless body of Wyrmuk the Undying, Reading one of these great scrolls invariably unleashed a curse.</p>

                        <p>I have found that the longer I must fight off horror, blindnes or liquefaction, the more valuable is the information the scroll contains.</p>
                        <p>It is not sufficient to simply use Force powers, as the Jedi teach.</p>
                        <p>Ritual gives spellcasting added power.</p>
                        <p>Memorize the incantations, speak them with conviction, and weave the invisible lines of power through gesture.</p>
                        <p>Through this, I have changed the world in ways my teachers never imagined.</p>

                        <p>Better to leave hundreds blinded with a binding curse than surrender power to a single fool.</p>
                        <p>The abilities described in the ancient Sith language are new and astonishing.</p>

                        <p>Sith spells that require vocalization are written in the Sith tongue, and consequently must be pronounced as such.</p>
                        <p>Be aware that it is more than recitation. Your inflection must be both  precise and passionate.</p>

                        <p>Spells, however, require time to prepare and to recite— they are challenging to use during combat.</p>
                        <p>Sith kings often remove their best sorcerers from the battlefield's scrum, positioning them atop high parapets where they rain curses upon the enemy's legions below. The potency of incantation can be enhanced with amulets and runic raiment. Robes, known as the Wraps of Frost, are inked with hexes and draw power from the mummy they shroud. For a hundred years, that power grows as it steeps in the mummy's dark energies.</p>
