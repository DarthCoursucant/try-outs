            <div id="power-of-sith-text">
                <p>The capital city of Livien Magnus has fallen. I have brought glory to the Empire, but my satisfaction was cut short by the arrival of Lord Adraas.</p>
                <p>Lord Adraas arrived two days ago, sent by the Dark Council to assist in our operations. His presence and the Council's decision anger me. Our siege of Livien Magnus had only been in effect a week, hardly enough time to declare it a stalemate.</p>
                <p>The city would have fallen when its people starved. Was that not the strategy behind the Mandalorian Blockade, which the Dark Council orchestrated? The tactic choked traffic along the Hydian Way and made our current campaign possible. Yet, the Council dares to hint that I lack courage.</p>
                <p>Worse still is Adraas's smirking confidence during our strategy sessions. How I hate that weakling, Who seeks his own advancement over the goals of the Sith Empire Adraas brought ten platoons of war droids, roughly half of them Mark I models and the other half Mark IIs. </p>
                <p>Adras is confident these droids can blast through the city's perimeter defenses and clear a path to the shield generator that is covering the city in a protective energy canopy. I do not disabuse him of this notion.</p>
                <p>I know Mark I war droids are well armed, with rapid-fire twin blasters attached to each arm. Mark II droids have similar weaponry and better armor-but neither model is nimble.</p>
                <p>The Colicoid insects that built them installed a pointy-legged, shuffing Locomotion system that leaves them vulnerable to flanking maneuvers.</p>
                <p>Venemal and I have both witnessed</p>
                <p>So with a small nod toward Lord Venemal, we agreed with Lord Adraas as he announced his intention to stage an assault on the southern gate. We watched as the war droids were sent into battle and were chewed to shrapnel in the crossfire of the Republic's entrenched infantry.</p>
                <p>But the failure did provide a distraction. With the enemy's attention focused elsewhere, Lord Venemal led his commandos over the western wall and blasted a hole from the inside out, enabling the rest of our troops to pour into the city.</p>
                <p>We shut down the shield generator in less than an hour.</p>
                <p>I then called in air support to shatter all remaining pockets of resistance.</p>
                <p>Should it surprise me that Lord Adraas claimed credit for the victory when he reported the news to Darth Angral?</p>
                <p>No, I am not surprised. I am disgusted.</p>
