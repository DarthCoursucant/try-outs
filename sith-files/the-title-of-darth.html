                        <p>If my plan had not worked and Kaan had not killed himself with the thought bomb, I would have been forced to kill him myself.</p>
                        <p>The annihilation at Ruusan was a gift, wiping out all those who were not worthy.</p>
                        <p><b>I, Darth Bane, and my apprentice, Darth Zannah,</b> survived and returned the potency of the Sith to our hands, so the Rule of Two could be instituted.</p>
                        <p>It is no accident that I took the title of Darth when I gained a mastery of the dark side, nor is it an accident that Kaan and his followers rejected it. It is a title of power.</p>

                        <p>Some believe the Darth itself is derived from the ancient Rakatan term darr tah, meaning "triumph over death," or daritha, meaning "emperor."</p>

                        <p>And who was among the last to hold the Darth title- until I took it up again.</p></p>
                        <p>Lord Kaan preached that all were equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness, but he did not dare to appoint a thousand Darths.</p>
                        <p>In fact, he did not permit the use of the title at all.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps its use would have forced Kaan to confront the truth-that his approach to the Force was a disgrace.</p>
                        <p>I restored the title of Darth to the Rule of Two so that only the worthy may hold it from this time, until the end of time.</p>
