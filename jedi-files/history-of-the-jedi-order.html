                        <p>The Force is timeless, but we Jedi have not always been present to interpret its teachings.</p>
                        <p>Centuries before the founding of the Republic, our predecessors first heard the Forces call on the Deep Core world of Tython.</p>
                        <p>The seers of Tython knew the energy field as the Ashla, but understood it in much the same way we do today as a source of wisdom.</p>
                        <p>A regenerative pool from which to draw strength, and a way to move objects without touching them.</p>

                        <p>Yet those seers who used their abilities in the service of hatred and greed fell into darkness. </p>
                        <p>The Force Wars of Tython are the earliest recorded conflicts between the light and the dark, battles that would be mirrored over the centuries as the Jedi and Sith crossed blades.</p>
                        <p>The Force Wars were fought with swords, their metal blades Force-enhanced for strength and sharpness.</p>
                        <p>For even at this stage, the Jedi forebears had discovered it is difficult to wield a weapon that does not act as if it is an extension of ones own body.</p>

                        <p>With technology from off worlders, the earliest lightsabers came into existence-and became the symbols of the Order.</p>
                        <p>From Tython, the first Jedi Knights spread into the galaxy as proactive defenders of the light, settling on Ossus near Hutt Space. </p>
                        <p>When the Galactic Republic announced its peaceful formation in the Core Worlds, the Jedi Knights vowed to defend its ideals of exploration, knowledge, and justice.</p>
                        <p>Ossus remained the center of the Order, but, during the Great Sith War, the explosion of the Cron supernova scoured the surface of that proud planet.</p>

                        <p>On many occasions, war darkened our doors, including the infamous sacking of Coruscant by the Sith, which left the Temple a smoking battleground.</p>
                        <p>Our resilience saw us through.</p>
                        <p>The Order has at last defeated the Sith, following a war that lasted a thousand years.</p>
