                <h1>The Useful Bureaucrat</h1>
                <h2>By Darth Sidious</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>My Master, Darth Plagueis, developed an obsession with midi-chlorians, neglecting his greatest talent — manipulating the strings that kept the galaxy from degenerating into anarchy. As a key figure in the InterGalactic Banking Clan, he was well acquainted with the business leaders and politicians who shaped the very galaxy — yet for all their power, not one of them was recognizable to general citizens.</p>
                <p>Control of this invisible steering committee is vital to the rule of the Empire, for their fortunes are tied to the regime's success. The corporate entities, the Senate, the HoloNet, and the military are all under my control. The loss of any one would undermine my central authority.</p>
                <p>There are, of course, unspoken members of this vital committee. Nothing could be accomplished without the tacit support of petty crime lords. Chief among these are the Hutt cartels, the Bothan Spy Networks, the Black Sun underworld syndicate, and the Bounty Hunters Guild.</p>
                <p>These groups are not in any measurable way different from the bankers and traders. They will remain content as long as profits are strong.</p>
                <p>But fear must be stoked from time to time. They must be reminded that doing business with Rebels and seditionists leads to punishment and financial ruin.</p>
                <p>The military families of the Core hold influence over their sectors and have long hungered for a strong hand at the top. Although the Clone Wars have ended, I have heard no whisperings from anyone wishing to dismantle our armies. I will fortify the Galactic Empire, and my authority, with the greatest strength the galaxy has ever seen.</p>
                <p>TIE fighters will scream through the skies while stormtroopers and armored walkers will round up dissenters on any planet unwilling to submit to my rule. Imperial Star Destroyers will orbit above population centers, waiting for orders to open fire if their leaders fail to see the benefits of becoming an Imperial possession.</p>
                <p>Finally, my Death Star will be the ultimate battle station and the personification of fear. Its weapon will shatter planets and extinguish all will to fight across the galaxy. When complete, the Death Star will spell an end to the insignificant threats of rebellions and organized protests.</p>
