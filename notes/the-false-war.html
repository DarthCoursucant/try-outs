                <h1>The False War</h1>
                <h2>By Darth Sidious</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>Fear was a necessary component in destroying the Jedi and burning away the putrefying vestiges of the Republic.</p>
                <p>But first I had to create that fear. The fear of revolution, of destruction, and of death.</p>
                <p>I had to create a war on a massive scale.</p>
                <p>My apprentice Count Dooku rallied star systems to his banner, inflaming passions among Rim citizens. This naturally deepened the fears of Core residents, who clamored for protection like brush-kits mewling for their mothers. The clone army I had prepared was met with applause and relief. And so began the Clone Wars.</p>
                <p>It did not matter at all that I dictated orders to the Separatists through my apprentice. Nor that every Republic victory was followed with a carefully planned defeat. The benefits of the false war were count-less. From the clone army came a battle fleet and an arsenal of new mechanized weapons of war. Overnight, the Republic had a class of military elites who swore their loyalty to the Supreme Chancellor. The Senators feared that being painted as disloyal would make them unelectable, so they supported measures to dismantle all checks on centralized power. On the opposite side, the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guild, and other corporate conglomerates joined together to protect their profits. They unknowingly pledged their allegiance to the Sith.</p>
                <p>The Jedi did not want war, but they had little choice.</p>
                <p>They had to join the fight lest they face public scorn.</p>
                <p>There on the front lines, my war struck down my enemies and shredded their morals until they were on the brink of the dark side. The Jedi were never the true heroes. I saw to that by manipulating the HoloNet. The people were led to fear the Jedi's arrogance and strange power.</p>
                <p>By crafting the news, the clone troopers and their noble chancellor became the fearless heroes of the Republic.</p>
                <p>When the time came for the Jedi to be eliminated, the public did not mourn them.</p>
                <p>When the Senate learned that the Jedi had attempted a coup and needed to be exterminated, they responded with absolute certainty. And when the people saw smoke rising from the Jedi Temple, they felt relief.</p>
