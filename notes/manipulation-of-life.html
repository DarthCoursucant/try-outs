                <h1>Manipulation Of Life</h1>
                <h2>By Darth Sidious</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>The future of my Empire is found in the mysteries of life—how to hold on to it so that my reign will never end.</p>
                <p>And how to twist it to create colossi that will do my bid-ding. Not even nature can stand in my way.</p>
                <p>I have mastered the dark side arts of deception, fear, and anger, but the Science of Darkness represented by the writings of Sorzus Syn and Darth Plagueis is open for exploration. Amusingly, the philosophies of the two authors could not be more opposed.</p>
                <p>Both Sith Lords understood that living things are not special. They are a resource to be harvested and shaped by the powerful. Through the dark side, I can make many new shapes.</p>
                <p>The alchemy developed by Syn is being perfected on Byss, where my Dark Side Adepts join their potent skills to warp life on a broad scale. My monstrous chrysalides, with their magnificent metal-piercing fangs, guard the ramparts of my citadel. My mute Imperial sentinels stand by my throne, their annihilated minds and enslaved wills clear evidence the dark side can manipulate clones for any imaginative purpose.</p>
                <p>Although alchemy can create perfect beings, I have designed weaknesses into all of these creations. The flaws are minute and known only to me. It would not do for any creature to be stronger than its creator.</p>
                <p>These experiments will lead to greater things opportunities for me to create new beings of my own design.</p>
                <p>What then will separate me from the gods of Naboo myth?</p>
                <p>The philosophy of creating monsters is applicable to the most fundamental elements of life. Darth Plagueis focused much too narrowly on midichlorians, but he was right about a great many things. The dark side consumes the physical body-just as mine became misshapen after the attempted Jedi assassination-but the mind can be preserved.</p>
                <p>Through the art of dark transfer, I will soon move myself to a younger body cloned from my own cells.</p>
                <p>I will achieve immortality.</p>
                <p>Even if I am killed, I will return from the chaos of nonbeing to restored physical life.</p>
                <p>This, even my Master could not achieve. I knew it was so when I halted his breathing and watched the light vanish from his eyes. He sought the secret of life, to live forever, but I took his life. I remain the ultimate Sith.</p>
                <p>Throughout the eras, the Sith foretold of a being who would destroy their Order and rebuild it stronger than before. I do not care about ancient prophecies. The approval of the dead is meaningless. Yet it is clear that the Sith'ari could be no other than me.</p>
                <p>The Imperial age has begun.</p>
                <p>I have centuries to expound on my philosophies, yet all knowledge flows from the dark side writings collected here. Let these pages mark the inception of the first Book of Sith.</p>
