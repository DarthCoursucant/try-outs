                <h1>Exile And Arrival</h1>
                <h2>By Unknown Jen'jidai Member</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>I am not Sith. I do not share their blood. Yet, in the time since we arrived among these savage people, we have become their rulers. For the Force-strong must ever seek power. We have adopted their titles, their dress, and their traditions. We are no longer Jedi expelled from the Republic's smothering embrace.</p>
                <p>We are the Jen'jidai, Lords of the Sith.</p>
                <p>We arrived here after the hundred-year war that nearly toppled their Jedi Order. The Jedi, so confident in their triumph, did not execute us. With lightsaber points at our backs, they marched us aboard the galleon that would take us into exile, outside the Republic's borders.</p>
                <p>There were twelve of us, including several ranking commanders:</p>
                <p>High General Ajunta Pall; Marchioness XoXaan, commander of the Black Legions; Baron Dreypa, our fleet's sole remaining admiral; Karness Muur, whose Force-centered battle tactics had saved us from the trap at Fluwhaka; and I, Sorzus Syn, grower of living weapons and biological plagues. Other less distinguished Dark Jedi were prominent within our company only because they had not perished in the war.</p>
                <p>The war had raged for a century between the Jedi Council, with its petrified orthodoxy, and those who wished to topple it. As the last survivors of those who sought a new path to power, we ultimately fell victim to the military excess of the Jedi at the Rout of Corbos.</p>
                <p>Our punishment for high treason was to be banished into uncharted space. But our flight into the unknown was not without direction. For years, I extracted information from refugees and cataloged rumors, searching for proof that the kingdom of Sith-Sith Purebloods— existed. My beliefs have been vindicated. What lies before us is a limitless pool of steadfast warriors and an untapped wealth of knowledge about the dark side of the Force.</p>
