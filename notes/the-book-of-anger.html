                <h1>The Book Of Anger</h1>
                <h2>By Darth Sidious</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>Through the principles of anger, I will structure and maintain my Empire. The writings of Darth Malgus confirm that anger, combined with will, is the key to power. When anger intensifies to rage, it is unstoppable.</p>
                <p>Malgus submitted utterly to the dark side, and doing so made him an exemplary warrior. His battlefield feats have never been duplicated.</p>
                <p>It must be understood that anger can be funneled through the body and released near the heart at the "vital gate." </p>
                <p>The destruction that can be unleashed by this method is immense. Thousands of enemies can be annihilated in a single act of malice.</p>
                <p>In time, the channeled anger of the dark side will prove just as destructive as the Death Star. There will no longer be a need for costly constructions. Already, 1 have perfected the Force maelstrom, which creates an invulnerable energy sphere to block incoming attacks while bombarding enemies with debris and electrifying them with bolts of lightning.</p>
                <p>This technique can be increased into a Force Storm.</p>
                <p>The churning energy mass of a Force Storm can consume everything it touches, for at its eye is pure hate. Just as a black hole devours a star, this storm can swallow armies and fold space. It may take decades to master this art, but once I have perfected it, I will be invincible.</p>
                <p>Anger has more uses than personal strength. A strong ruler knows that fear can keep commoners in line, but anger can weaken enemies.</p>
                <p>Indeed, my subjects fear me, but that fear will lead to anger. And anger will make my Empire strong.</p>
                <p>However, anger directed toward authority is dangerous. It must be channeled toward other, weaker subjects. By encouraging fear of the exotic and the unusual, a regime can be strengthened.</p>
                <p>The Empire has uniformity in its symbols and its ideology, which makes it easier to shame those who do not belong and to make them the objects of a galaxy's rage.</p>
                <p>The Republic's alien species are the simplest targets.</p>
                <p>Most humans of the Core already despise looking into their multiple eyes or listening to their clicking, buzzing languages. They hate their bewildering customs and their sharp stench. Coruscant is a seething boil of species, but ! humans far outnumber any other species. It is an ideal place to sow seeds of suspicion — to instill the idea that those who don't conform are the enemy and enemies must be destroyed. By making the powerless a target, the people will not threaten the one in power. On the contrary, the ruler will be venerated as a hero for exposing the weak.</p>
                <p>As Darth Bane instituted the Rule of Two, so I will begin the Rule of One. The Sith will now be sustained by one - one to hold the power and others, talented in the Force, to execute my will as dark side agents.</p>
                <p>Although the Jedi Order has been obliterated, many Force-sensitives have survived. Those who still hold to the belief that there is virtue in "peace" or in closing one's self off to sensation— will be made to conform.</p>
                <p>They must find value in the ways of the dark.</p>
                <p>Unleashing their anger is fundamental for drawing them into my fold as well as for them to gain an understanding of the dark side. For it is in anger that Force-users are strongest. Once tapped, this emotion can turn idealists into slaves. Even those with brightly burning passions— those who vow to resist with their dying breath-can be broken in three simple steps.</p>
                <p>First, they must be tempted.</p>
                <p>The strong willed always have something they desire, or something they possess that they fear to lose. They will see their drive to protect this item as noble. By encouraging this delusion, a puppet is created.</p>
                <p>Second, the puppets must be tested. By creating an immediate danger or placing the subjects in peril, they will be forced to make a decision.</p>
                <p>Crazed by fear and the mere thought of losing what they hold dear, they will do anything that is asked of them, if only to preserve their most cherished desires.</p>
                <p>Third, they must be forced to submit. A moment will arise when they will take a step too far. In panic or fear, they will hurt others or commit a crime in such a way the outside world will never forgive. After that moment, there is no return from the dark side. Some who have been ensnared will choose to end their lives. Most, how-ever, will accept their role as new warriors of the dark side. One life has ended, and a better one has begun.</p>
                <p>As the new Rule of One is enacted, I will be free to enlist a throng of dark side followers. These talented mimics will be trained to replicate a smattering of my abilities yet will never take even a fraction of my authority.</p>
                <p>The Inquisitors is an arm of Imperial Intelligence tasked with extracting information through torture. The most effective will serve as Grand Inquisitors, and the best of those will be selected as Emperor's Hands. These elite agents will be handpicked for loyalty and stealth. They shall be unseen enforcers across the breadth of my vast dominion.</p>
                <p>The red-robed Royal Guard will protect me from those who think themselves worthy of an audience with their Emperor. Within their ranks, a few who are in touch with the Force will comprise a rarefied warrior unit called the Shadow Guard.</p>
                <p>The captured Padawans and survivors from the Jedi Service Corps are less gifted in the Force, but they will serve me nonetheless as Dark Side Adepts. Until I have use for them, they shall remain on Byss, where their connection to the Force will intensify the planet's growing nexus of dark side potency.</p>
