                <p>The war in which we fought, and in which many of our followers died, could have been prevented. It was the Jedi who took up arms to keep us from revealing the truth about the Force. They had been paddling in the shallows for cons. By boldly venturing into the Forces expanse, we gained powers that no Jedi had ever possessed. Life itself was at our command.</p>
                <p>It was I who grew the Leviathans, who splintered the Jedi barricades at Balmorra. I gave them the ability to swallow spirits and to store those life energies in skin-blisters. The Leviathans, my exquisite monsters, were the final culmination of the Shamblers, the Howlers, the Pit Horrors, and all the other spawn I'd given shape and purpose to—my purpose.</p>
                <p>The Jedi shunned this power, as they have resisted every improvement. They caused the schism in their own ranks.</p>
                <p>Until we annihilate the old Order, the pattern will continue repeating forever.</p>
