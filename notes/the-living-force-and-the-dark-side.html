                <p>Other groups, like those of the vedi and the Sith, use strange cold terms to deserbe the work of the spirits They talk of the unifying force and the living force - of the light side and the dark side. We must forgiue their ignorance, for they are not Shamans of Dathomir. Their leaders cannot understand such concepts without enduring a trial such as mine.</p>
                <p>There is no need to separate what they call the liuing Force from the unifying Force. Both are manifestations of the Twin Deities, and both are uibrantly, overuhelm-ingly alive. This classification of light side and dark side is also misquided. Is it evil to kill? Would those who answer yes be satisfied if predators starued so grazers could strip the land unopposed only to die amid famine? Is this the bloodless utopia envisioned by the moralistic jedi?</p>
                <p>What the Jedi call the dark side, lightsisters know to be the essence of life.</p>
                <p>Even some of our witch clans haue made the same error as the vedi, ignoring those spirits voices that call for blood and labeling them as evil. My sisters, do not concern yourselues with dark side or light side. That is the language of the outsiders!</p>
                <p>Our abilities were bestowed by the spirits. The Winged Goddess and the Fanged God bestow the passiue and aggressive energies that animate every creature and allow each to draw breath. Would you choose to deny yourself? Do not limit your scope by obeying artificial rules.</p>
